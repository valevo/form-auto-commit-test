    ### History
    
    The Groote Koninklijke Bazar was a department store for Asian wares in The Hague. Its owner [Dirk Boer](https://rkd.nl/artists/349840) (1803-1877) began selling goods in 1825 and opened a store on Zeestraat in 1843. The store sold Asian items, mainly from [Japan](https://sws.geonames.org/1861060), [China](https://sws.geonames.org/1814991), [Persia](https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11840/termmaster8272) and the [Ottoman Empire](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12560), as well as from [the Dutch East Indies](https://sws.geonames.org/1643084). The buyers were private individuals, including King [Willem II](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q154287), as well as museums, such as the [Royal Cabinet of Curiosities](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2Fcc7609accb9857dc8ca777ff1d6d4af1) and the then [Rijks Ethnografisch Museum](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2F77c1a0cf982b33b9e88073c4a704049b). After Boer's death, the business continued under new owners.
