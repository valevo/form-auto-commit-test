    ### Description
    
    During the time of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and the Dutch West India Company (WIC) the companies were also responsible for church and missionary work in the Dutch overseas territories, in the eastern and western colonies, respectively. The companies did not allow private missionaries although the Herrnhuters were given access to Suriname from the eighteenth century. For this reason, the church archives from this period are part of the Company archives, which in the case of the VOC are held by the National Archives of the Republic of Indonesia (ANRI). The Dutch government took over the ecclesiastical responsibilities of the VOC and WIC in the 19th century, which led to the creation of the Protestant Church in the Dutch East Indies, also known as the Indische Kerk, and the Protestant Church in the West Indies. This change made it possible for Dutch Christians to carry out missionary work in the Dutch overseas territories. Following the English example, the [Nederlandsch Zendeling Genootschap](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1946670) (Netherlands Missionary Society) was founded in 1797 with its base in Rotterdam.

    Many members and donors of the NZG were affiliated with the Dutch Reformed Church. Most of the NZG missionaries were stationed in [Java](https://sws.geonames.org/1642673) and [Sulawesi](https://sws.geonames.org/9062340), and to a lesser extent were also active in other areas within the former [Dutch East Indies](https://sws.geonames.org/1643084). The NZG was very active in collecting objects. The NZG collection was used to teach future missionaries about languages and cultures in the former Dutch East Indies . Later, the collections were loaned to various exhibitions and museums, such as the 1883 World Exhibition and the Museum voor Land-, Taal- en Volkenkunde (now Wereldmuseum Rotterdam).

    In addition to the actual missionary work, missionaries also supervised public education and were active in all kinds of other areas such as scientific research, but also managing shops and printing workshops.

    ### Provenance research

    The NZG archive is available through the [Utrecht Archives](https://hetutrechtsarchief.nl/onderzoek/resultaten/archieven?mivast=39&mizig=210&miadt=39&miview=inv2&milang=nl&mizk_alle=1102-1&micode=1102-1) within the inventory of the legal predecessors of the Raad voor de Zending. This archive access provides extensive information about the history of the NZG and the organisation's record keeping. The [publicity section](https://hetutrechtsarchief.nl/collectie/609C5B9FAC4B4642E0534701000A17FD), under 1.2.2.6. 8, contains documents about objects belonging to the NZG that were loaned to the World Exhibition in 1867 and 1883 and to the Museum voor Land- en Volkenkunde (now Wereldmuseum Rotterdam). These documents are digitally available.

    The [Repetorium van Nederlandse zendings- en missie-archieven 1800-1960] (https://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/repertoriumzendingmissie/gids/organisatie/3356531829), which was compiled by the Huygens Institute, contains a detailed entry on the Nederlandsch Zendeling Genootschap. It contains a brief history of the society and references to relevant source publications and archive material.
