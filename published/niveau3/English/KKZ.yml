    ### History of the collection
    
    The Royal Cabinet of Curiosities was a museum in The Hague, founded in 1816 by [King Willem I](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2079957). The museum took the form of a cabinet of curiosities and its collection comprised a wide array of objects, including many from Dutch and other powers’ colonies. Ultimately, it housed all sorts: objects related to Dutch history, Asian [applied arts](https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11840/termmaster10049837), [ethnographic objects](https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11840/termmaster10068984), and [naturalia](https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11840/termmaster10049008).
    

    The basis of the collection was formed by Chinese and Japanese objects collected by [Jean Theodore Royer](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34232414), a preacher and lawyer with a fascination for Chinese language and literature who amassed a large collection of prints, paintings and documents, [Jan Cock Blomhoff](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1973328), among other things a warehouse manager at the Dutch trading post on the Japanese peninsula [Dejima](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q640267), and [Johan van Overmeer Fisscher](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q21549843), who also worked on Dejima. [King Willem I](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2079957) subsequently contributed the stadtholders’ collections. In the course of its existence the museum also received various donations and made acquisitions. Eventually the collection comprised significant collections of Japanese and Chinese objects and numerous items  – many of which were diplomatic gifts from the stadholders’ collections – from Southeast Asia and the West African Gold Coast as well as from North America and Oceania. 
    The museum was dissolved in 1883 and its collection distributed among several museums. The majority went to the Rijks Etnografisch Museum (now [Wereldmuseum Leiden](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2F77c1a0cf982b33b9e88073c4a704049b) and the [Nederlandsch Museum voor Geschiedenis en Kunst](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2F0d0d07f9e69d73c961b30ffd357c1e47) (subsumed into the Rijksmuseum). Small numbers of objects were transferred to the [National Museum of Antiquities](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2F732277d365ab6fbcc351da7bc2b900b3), the [Koninklijk Kabinet van Munten, Penningen en Gesneden Stenen](https://rkd.nl/library/400001411), the [Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2Fb897e22a1eae224b0ca13b5ec14d51cb), the [Rijksmuseum van Geologie en Mineralogie](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7333956) and the [Rijksherbarium](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2152927).
   
    ### Provenance research
    
    The original records of the collection, created by the first director [Reinier van de Kasteele](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q56097178), disappeared after his son [Abraham van de Kasteele](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18507671) succeeded him in 1840. Many objects also went missing or were lost during this time. The third and final director [David van der Kellen](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5905167), who took office in 1876, had to put things in order. As can be read in Rudolf Effert's book (Volkenkundig Verzamelen, pp. 213-216), in 1876-1879 Van der Kellen drew up a new inventory of objects, in which he attempted to link remaining documentation to objects in the extensive collection. Mistakes were made in this process.
   
    The archive of the Royal Cabinet of Curiosities is held in the [Noord-Hollands Archief](https://noord-hollandsarchief.nl/) as part of the Rijksmuseum archive. It includes correspondence regarding donations and acquisitions. The appendices include additional access with convenient overviews of this correspondence. Please note that the KKZ’s correspondence also relates to items that were offered to the collection but were ultimately not acquired.
    
    In addition, archival documents are held at the [National Archives of the Netherlands](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/), written by officials of the Ministry of the Interior. These relate to acquisitions, as well as the dissolution of the Royal Cabinet of Curiosities and the distribution of the collection among the various museums. The letter archive of the Ministry of the Interior contains notes verbales and letters regarding submitted donations and sales. These can be traced using the indices in the notes verbales.
